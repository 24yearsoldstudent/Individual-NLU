## Dataset Introduction
### Stance Detection 
The original dataset is derived from [SemEval-2016 Task 6: Detecting Stance in Tweets](https://aclanthology.org/S16-1003/). In 2019, [Aldayel et.al](https://github.com/AbeerAldayel/Stance_detection) expanded the dataset and collected the UserID corresponding to some tweets.
